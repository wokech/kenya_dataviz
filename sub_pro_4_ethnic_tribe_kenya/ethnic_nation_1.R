# C) EDA

# 1) Total Population - STACKED BAR CHART

# 2) Large tribe totals - TREEMAP WITH NUMBERS INSIDE

# 3) Large tribe and subtribes (bar plot, maybe wordcloud)

# i)  Subtribes in a large tribe that are less than 100k (~22 tribes)

# ii)  Subtribes in a large tribe that are greater than 100k and less than 1M (~21 tribes)

# iii)  Subtribes in a large tribe that are greater than 1M (~5 tribes)

# 4) Small tribes and subtribes (bar plot,  maybe wordcloud)

# i) Subtribes in small tribes

# ii) Small tribes with no subtribes

# 5) Non-kenyans

# i) East Africans

# ii) Other nationals
